# Image-Caption-Generator

In this Python project, I have implemented the Image Caption Generator using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory). The image features will be extracted from Xception which is a CNN model trained on the imagenet dataset and then we feed the features into the LSTM model which will be responsible for generating the image captions.
